The Daily Post Card web application has two views: the creator view and the display view. When the user is in creator mode, they are able to upload an image, change the background color, type a message, and change the font. When the user clicks the "Share Postcard" button, the information about their postcard is sent to the server via an AJAX POST request. A new "display" webpage is then loaded, showing the postcard that they created. 

NOTE: 
Recieving error: "req.body undefined"
Display page still works, but occasionally does not.
